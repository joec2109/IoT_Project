# IoT_Project
 My Internet of Things project for my third year at university.

For this project, I created a mobile game.

I used Prim's algorithm to randomly generate the mazes for each level.

There are 10 levels, each with a different maze to complete.

Players must navigate around the maze using the on-screen buttons, avoiding enemies (represented as green squares) and collecting coins (represented as yellow squares).
